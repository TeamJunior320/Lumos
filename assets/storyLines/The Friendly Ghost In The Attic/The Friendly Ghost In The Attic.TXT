The Friendly Ghost in the Attic

Once upon a time, in a big, old house at the edge of the forest, there lived a little ghost named Casper. Casper wasn’t like the other ghosts—he wasn’t spooky or scary at all. He had a big smile and loved to help.

Casper lived in the attic, where the dusty old books and forgotten treasures were kept. Every night, while the house was quiet, Casper would float around, dusting the shelves and tidying up the toys. He loved making the house feel cozy.

One evening, a little girl named Lily moved into the house with her family. She was a little nervous about living in such an old place, especially since her parents told her stories about ghosts.

One night, as she was exploring the attic, she saw something shiny. “What’s this?” she wondered, picking up an old, sparkly button.

“Hello!” a soft voice said from behind her.

Lily turned around and gasped—but then she saw the friendly ghost with a big smile and twinkling eyes.

“I’m Casper!” the ghost said happily. “I like to help keep the house clean.”

Lily blinked in surprise. “You’re not scary!”

“Not at all!” said Casper, laughing. “I just want to be friends!”

From then on, every night, Lily would visit the attic. She’d talk to Casper, play with the toys, and listen to stories about the old house. And in return, Casper would help her with her homework and show her hidden treasures.

The two of them became the best of friends, and Lily wasn’t afraid of the house anymore. In fact, she looked forward to every night she spent with her friendly ghost.
