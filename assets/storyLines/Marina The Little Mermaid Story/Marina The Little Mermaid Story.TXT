Marina the Little Mermaid

Deep down in the sparkling blue sea lived a cheerful little mermaid named Marina. She had shiny teal fins, a necklace made of sea pearls, and a voice as sweet as a seashell song.

Marina loved to collect treasures from above the waves—buttons, shiny spoons, and even tiny toy boats! But most of all, she loved to make new friends.

One day, while swimming near Coral Cove, she found a baby dolphin stuck in a net. “Oh no! Don’t worry, little one—I’ll help you!” said Marina.

She tugged and pulled, and with a little help from her crab friend, Clippy, she freed the dolphin. The baby dolphin squeaked with joy and gave Marina a happy splash.

The next morning, Marina had an idea. “What if we made a safe spot for all sea creatures to rest and play?”

So with help from her ocean friends—turtles, seahorses, and even a sleepy octopus—they built the Sea Garden: a place full of glowing coral, soft sand, and colorful shells.

Word spread quickly, and soon, creatures from all over the ocean visited the Sea Garden. Marina greeted them all with a smile.

She didn’t just collect treasures anymore—she shared kindness, and that made her shine even brighter.

And Marina, the little mermaid with the big heart, swam happily ever after.
