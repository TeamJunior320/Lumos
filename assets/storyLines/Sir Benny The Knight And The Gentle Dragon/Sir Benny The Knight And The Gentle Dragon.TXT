Sir Benny the knight and the Gentle Dragon

Once upon a time, in a kingdom full of sunshine and laughter, there lived a brave little knight named Sir Benny. He had shiny silver armor, a red feather in his helmet, and a big heart.

One day, a message came to the castle:
A dragon has been seen near Berry Hill!

The king looked worried. “Who will go see what’s wrong?”
“I will!” said Sir Benny with a smile.

He packed a snack, polished his shield, and rode off on his pony named Popcorn.

When he reached Berry Hill, he didn’t find a scary dragon. He found a big green dragon sitting under a tree, crying!

“Hello,” said Sir Benny kindly. “Why are you sad?”

“I’m not mean,” sniffled the dragon. “I just sneezed too hard and scared everyone!”

Sir Benny giggled. “That happens to me too—especially around flowers!”

The dragon smiled a little.

Sir Benny shared his snack, and they played catch with apples. The dragon was gentle and funny, and they became fast friends.

When Sir Benny brought the dragon to the village, he introduced him to everyone. “This is Dizzy the Dragon. He’s kind and just wants friends.”

The people cheered, and from that day on, Dizzy helped light lanterns with his warm breath and gave flying rides to the children.

Sir Benny and Dizzy were heroes—not because they fought—but because they showed the kingdom how friendship beats fear.
