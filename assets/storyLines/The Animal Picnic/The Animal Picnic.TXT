The Animal Picnic

Once upon a time, deep in the heart of Sunny Meadow, the animals decided to have a big picnic.

Benny the Bear brought honey sandwiches.
Tilly the Turtle brought watermelon slices.
Ravi the Rabbit brought crunchy carrots.
And Polly the Parrot brought rainbow fruit salad—her favorite!

They laid out a big checkered blanket under the shade of an old oak tree. Everyone was happy… until they noticed someone was missing.

“Where’s Freddie the Fox?” asked Ravi.

“Maybe he didn’t get the invitation,” said Tilly.

So all the animals made a plan: they each took a treat and followed Freddie’s paw prints through the trees.

They found him sitting by himself. “I thought you didn’t want me at the picnic,” he said quietly.

“Of course we want you!” said Benny. “You’re our friend!”

Freddie smiled, and together they walked back to the picnic.

The food tasted even better with everyone there, and they laughed and played until the sun went down.

From that day on, no animal was ever left out—because friendship makes every picnic perfect.
