Princess Lila and the Cloud Crown

Once upon a time, in a kingdom above the clouds, there lived a cheerful princess named Lila. She had golden curls, sparkly shoes, and the biggest laugh in the land.

Princess Lila loved to play outside. She would race the wind, chase butterflies, and talk to the flowers. But most of all, she loved watching the clouds float by.

One morning, she looked up and saw a cloud shaped just like a crown! "I want a crown like that!" she giggled.

So, she asked the birds for help. The bluebird chirped, “Follow the breeze!” The owl hooted, “Climb the tallest hill!” And the bunny whispered, “Believe in cloud magic!”

Princess Lila packed a basket with cookies, her favorite book, and a soft scarf. She skipped through the fields, up the hill, and into the sky (with a little help from a friendly breeze).

At the very top, a fluffy cloud floated down. “You have a kind heart and a joyful spirit,” the cloud said. “You may wear the Cloud Crown.”

It gently placed the soft, shimmery crown on Lila’s head. It sparkled like snow and felt like a hug.

She thanked the cloud, slid down a rainbow, and returned home with a magical story.

From then on, Princess Lila wore her crown only when she played with others, because she believed kindness made everyone feel royal.

And they all laughed happily ever after.
