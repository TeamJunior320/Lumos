Lila and the Bear

Once upon a time, in a quiet village near the woods, lived a little girl named Lila. She loved picking wildflowers, chasing butterflies, and exploring nature.

One afternoon, while walking through the forest, Lila heard a soft sniffle. She followed the sound and found a big, fuzzy bear sitting on a log, wiping his nose with a leaf.

“Are you okay?” Lila asked.

The bear looked up with watery eyes. “I lost my honey jar,” he said sadly. “It rolled away down the hill.”

Lila smiled kindly. “Let’s go find it together!”

Hand in paw, they followed the trail of sticky honey drops. They climbed over logs, tiptoed through tall grass, and finally found the honey jar stuck between two rocks.

“Thank you!” said the bear, giving Lila a gentle bear hug.

From that day on, they became best friends. Lila visited the bear every weekend. They shared stories, had honey-picnics, and watched the stars together.

And the bear was never lonely again—because true friends can come in all shapes and sizes.
