The Evil Witch and the Brave Bunny

Once upon a time, in the middle of a dark, twisty forest, there lived a grumpy old witch named Grizelda. She had a crooked nose, a squeaky voice, and a big black hat that kept falling over her eyes.

Grizelda didn’t like laughter. She didn’t like flowers. And she really didn’t like bunnies.

One day, a cheerful little bunny named Pip hopped into her garden by mistake. He was looking for carrots, but instead found a bubbling green potion!

“GET OUT OF MY GARDEN!” shouted Grizelda, waving her wand.

But Pip just smiled and said, “You sound like you need a hug!”

Grizelda froze. No one had ever said that to her before.

“I do NOT need a hug!” she huffed. But Pip gave her one anyway.

Something strange happened… her hat flew off, her hair poofed up, and for the first time in years—Grizelda laughed! Just a little.

Pip stayed for tea (and carrots), and told silly stories. Every time Grizelda tried to frown, she accidentally smiled.

Soon, the forest wasn’t so dark anymore. Flowers began to grow in her yard, and animals started visiting.

Grizelda still wore black and still made potions—but now they were for sneezes and sore paws.

And all because one brave bunny believed even the grumpiest witch could change.
