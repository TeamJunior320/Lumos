The Little Fairy Who Lost Her Glow

In the heart of the Mistywood Forest, where mushrooms giggle and flowers hum lullabies, lived a tiny fairy named Faye. She had shimmering wings, a twinkling laugh, and a soft golden glow.

Faye loved to light the way for baby animals at night and make fireflies dance. But one morning, she woke up and—oh no!—her glow was gone!

“I must find it!” she whispered, a little worried but very brave.

She flew to the Dewdrop Lake and asked the frogs, “Have you seen my glow?”
“Try the Laughing Lily Patch,” croaked the frogs.

In the Lily Patch, the flowers giggled, “Maybe you left it near the Dream Tree.”

At the Dream Tree, an old owl blinked slowly and said, “Your glow comes from inside, little one. You just need to believe in your magic again.”

Faye sat quietly, took a deep breath, and remembered all the kind things she had done—helping lost bees, cheering up butterflies, and singing lullabies to sleepy bugs.

Suddenly—twinkle!—her glow came back, brighter than ever!

She zipped through the sky, lighting stars and painting sparkles in the air. All the forest cheered!

And from that day on, Faye never doubted her light again.
