Ollie the little boy and the Kind Witch

Once upon a time, in a village surrounded by hills and forests, lived a curious little boy named Ollie. He loved exploring, asking questions, and collecting shiny pebbles.

One day, Ollie wandered a little too far into the forest and got lost. The trees looked the same, and the path had disappeared.

Just as he started to worry, a gentle voice called out, “Are you lost, little one?”

Ollie turned and saw a woman in a big purple hat and a dress covered in leaves. She held a crooked wand and had a black cat on her shoulder.

“A witch!” Ollie gasped.

The woman smiled kindly. “Yes, but not the scary kind. I’m Willow. I help lost things find their way.”

Willow offered him warm tea from a glowing teapot and listened to Ollie’s story. Then, she waved her wand and whispered, “Show us the way, little breeze.”

A breeze swirled around them and led Ollie gently through the trees, back to the edge of his village.

“Thank you!” Ollie said. “You’re not scary at all!”

Willow chuckled. “Sometimes people fear what they don’t know. But kindness is the best kind of magic.”

From that day on, Ollie visited Willow often. They made potions with flowers, helped forest animals, and told stories under the stars.

And Ollie always told everyone: “Not all witches are wicked—some are just wonderful.”
