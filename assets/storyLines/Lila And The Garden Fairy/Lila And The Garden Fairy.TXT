Lila and the Garden Fairy

Once upon a time, in a small village with colorful houses and flower-filled yards, lived a little girl named Lila. She loved spending time in her garden—watering plants, talking to butterflies, and picking daisies for her mom.

One sunny morning, as she watered a patch of tulips, she noticed something tiny and sparkly fluttering nearby.

“Hello?” Lila whispered.

Out from behind a sunflower came a tiny fairy! She had wings that shimmered like rainbows and wore a dress made of petals.

“I’m Flora,” the fairy said. “Thank you for being so kind to the flowers. They told me all about you!”

Lila’s eyes grew wide. “The flowers talk?”

Flora giggled. “Only to fairies. But they can feel your love.”

Flora showed Lila how to plant fairy seeds—tiny glowing seeds that grew into sparkle-flowers at night. They danced around the garden, played hide-and-seek with ladybugs, and even made a little crown for Lila out of clover and moonbeams.

Before leaving, Flora gave Lila a tiny bell. “Ring it whenever you need me,” she said with a wink.

From that day on, Lila took extra good care of her garden—because she knew magic was real, and kindness made it grow.

And every now and then, when the moon was high and the flowers shimmered, a soft giggle could be heard... as a little fairy flew by.
