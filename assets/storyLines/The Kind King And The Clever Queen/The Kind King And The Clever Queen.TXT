The Kind King and the Clever Queen

Once upon a time, in a peaceful kingdom full of sunshine and singing birds, lived a kind King named Omar and a clever Queen named Lila.

King Omar loved helping people. He gave food to the hungry, toys to the children, and hugs to everyone who needed one.

Queen Lila loved solving problems. She read books, made plans, and always had a smart idea when something went wrong.

One day, a big storm came. The river flooded, and the village bridge washed away!

The people were worried. “How will we cross the river now?” they asked.

King Omar quickly brought warm food and blankets for everyone.

Then Queen Lila said, “Let’s build a new bridge—but this time, we’ll build it stronger and safer!”

Together with the villagers, they gathered wood, tied ropes, and worked hard. The king lifted heavy beams, and the queen showed where each piece should go.

Soon, a new bridge stood tall and strong across the river!

The people cheered, “Hooray for the King and Queen!”

King Omar smiled. “We helped with our hearts.”

Queen Lila added, “And with our minds!”

And from that day on, the kingdom knew: kindness and cleverness make the perfect team
