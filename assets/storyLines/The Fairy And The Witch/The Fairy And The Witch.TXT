The Fairy and the Witch

Once upon a time, in a land of twinkling stars and whispering trees, lived a bright little fairy named Faye and a grumpy old witch named Wanda.

Faye loved sunshine, flowers, and singing with the birds.
Wanda liked dark clouds, dusty books, and brewing potions in peace.

They lived on opposite sides of Sparkle Hill and had never spoken to each other—until one day, a big storm rolled in!

A bolt of lightning struck Wanda’s roof—CRACK! Her house was leaking and her magic books were getting wet!

Faye saw the trouble and flew over, even though everyone said, “Fairies and witches don’t get along!”

“Need help?” Faye asked kindly.

Wanda blinked in surprise. “You want to help me?”

Faye smiled. “Of course! Everyone needs a little magic sometimes.”

With a sprinkle of fairy dust and a flick of Wanda’s wand, they fixed the roof together. The storm cleared, and a rainbow stretched across the sky.

After that day, Faye and Wanda became friends. They had tea every week—Faye brought honey cakes, and Wanda brought bubbling blueberry punch.

And guess what? Sparkle Hill was happier than ever, because kindness turned magic even brighter.
