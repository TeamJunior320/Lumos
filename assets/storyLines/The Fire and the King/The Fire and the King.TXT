The Fire and the King

Once upon a time, in a grand castle at the edge of a vast kingdom, there lived a wise and brave King named Harold. King Harold loved his kingdom dearly and worked hard to keep everyone safe and happy. But there was one thing the king was afraid of—fire.

Every time there was a spark, a flicker, or even a small flame, the king would worry. He had seen how quickly fire could spread and how much damage it could cause. So, he ordered that all fires in the kingdom be carefully watched and kept under control.

One cold evening, as the sun set behind the mountains, a great fire began in the castle’s fireplace. At first, it was just a warm, friendly blaze that kept the castle cozy, but soon it grew larger and brighter, filling the room with heat.

The king rushed into the room, ready to call for help. But just as he entered, he heard a soft voice. “Don’t be afraid, King Harold,” said the fire. “I am not your enemy. I am here to help.”

King Harold blinked in surprise. "You... can talk?"

The fire flickered gently. “I can, indeed. I bring warmth and light. Without me, the nights would be cold, and many people would go hungry. I help cook meals, keep people warm, and light the way.”

The king looked at the fire, still a little unsure. “But sometimes, you can cause destruction. I don’t want to risk anyone getting hurt.”

The fire responded calmly, “I understand. But when I am controlled and cared for, I am your ally. I can keep the kingdom warm during the winter, help light the streets at night, and even help your people grow their crops with my warmth.”

King Harold thought for a moment, then nodded. “You are right. If you are cared for properly, you can do much good.”

From that day on, the king worked with his people to learn how to use fire wisely. They built safe hearths in every home, used fire to cook and heat their houses, and made sure no fire was ever left unattended.

King Harold learned to trust fire, and in return, fire helped make the kingdom brighter, warmer, and safer.
