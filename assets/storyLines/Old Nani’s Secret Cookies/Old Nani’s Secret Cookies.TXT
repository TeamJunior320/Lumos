Old Nani’s Secret Cookies

Once upon a time, in a little yellow house with blue windows, lived an old Nani named Amina. She wore colorful scarves, had twinkling eyes, and the softest hugs in the world.

Every Sunday, her grandchildren came over to play and listen to her stories. But the best part of the day was always… Nani’s cookies!

No one knew how she made them so magical. They were warm, sweet, and always made you smile—even if you were feeling a little grumpy.

One day, her youngest grandchild, Zara, asked, “Nani, what’s your secret?”

Nani just winked and said, “It’s a little bit of cinnamon... and a lot of love.”

Zara wasn’t satisfied. That night, she stayed behind to help in the kitchen. She watched as Nani mixed flour, sugar, and spice, and hummed a happy tune while baking.

“Why do you sing, Nani?” Zara asked.

“Because love goes into cookies through your heart and your hands,” Nani said with a smile.

Zara tried it too—she hummed while she stirred. And when the cookies came out of the oven, they tasted just like Nani’s: full of love.

From then on, Zara helped Nani every Sunday. And one day, when she was older, Zara made those cookies for her own children.

Because Nani’s secret wasn’t just in the recipe—it was in the joy of sharing.
