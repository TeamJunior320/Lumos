Max the Not-So-Scary Monster

In a cave at the edge of Sillywood Forest lived a small, fuzzy monster named Max. He had purple fur, three tiny horns, and the biggest, brightest smile.

But Max had a problem—everyone thought he was scary.

Whenever he walked into town, people would run and hide. “A monster!” they’d shout, even though Max only came to buy jellybeans or borrow books.

“I’m not scary,” Max sighed. “I just want to be friends.”

One day, he saw a little girl crying by the river. Her kite was stuck in a tree.

Max tiptoed over and said softly, “Can I help?”

She looked up, a little nervous, but nodded.

Max climbed the tree with his long, twisty toes and carefully brought the kite back down. “Here you go,” he said with a gentle grin.

The girl smiled. “Thank you! You’re not scary at all!”

The next day, she told everyone in town how kind Max was. Soon, kids came to play with him, and parents waved when he passed by.

Max became the town’s favorite helper—fixing fences, watering gardens, and always sharing his jellybeans.

And from then on, Max wasn’t the monster who scared people. He was Max the friendly monster—with the best hugs in Sillywood.
